    /// to map hash values to the Slots array. Items in the Slots array that hash to the same value
    /// are chained together through the "next" indices. 
    /// 
    /// The capacity is always prime; so during resizing, the capacity is chosen as the next prime
    /// greater than double the last capacity. 
    /// 
    /// The underlying data structures are lazily initialized. Because of the observation that, 
    /// in practice, hashtables tend to contain only a few elements, the initial capacity is
    /// set very small (3 elements) unless the ctor with a collection is used.
    /// 
    /// The +/- 1 modifications in methods that add, check for containment, etc allow us to 
    /// distinguish a hash code of 0 from an uninitialized bucket. This saves us from having to 
    /// reset each bucket to -1 when resizing. See Contains, for example.
    /// 
    /// Set methods such as UnionWith, IntersectWith, ExceptWith, and SymmetricExceptWith modify
    /// this set.
    /// 
    /// Some operations can perform faster if we can assume "other" contains unique elements
    /// according to this equality comparer. The only times this is efficient to check is if
    /// other is a hashset. Note that checking that it's a hashset alone doesn't suffice; we
    /// also have to check that the hashset is using the same equality comparer. If other 
    /// has a different equality comparer, it will have unique elements according to its own
    /// equality comparer, but not necessarily according to ours. Therefore, to go these 
    /// optimized routes we check that other is a hashset using the same equality comparer.
    /// 
    /// A HashSet with no elements has the properties of the empty set. (See IsSubset, etc. for 
    /// special empty set checks.)
